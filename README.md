# s_LinkedLists
Just a couple of functions of LinkedLists

There are total of 5 methods inside a class that serve for different purposes:
  1. setList() ----> makes desired number of nodes
  2. insertNode() ----> inserts a node at desired position 
  3. deleteNode() ----> deletes a node at desired position
  4. i_revList() ----> reverse a list iteratively
  5. getList() ----> prints the nodes to the screen
  
All of the methods above are actually iterative methods for solving these Linked List problems. There are of course
recursive methods which will be further discussed.

Hope this helped someone, take care.
